  <p id="para">Each embedded browsing context has its own session history and active document. The browsing context that contains the
    embedded content is called the parent browsing context. The topmost browsing context—the one without a parent—is usually
    the browser window, represented by the Window object. Because each embedded browsing content created by is itself a complete
    document environment, every use of within a page can cause substantial increases in the amount of memory and other computing
    resources required by the document overall, so while theoretically you can use as many as you like on a page, you should
    keep the potential for performance issues in mind.</p>
